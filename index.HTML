        <h2>About</h2>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>Killua Zoldyck (キルア゠ゾルディック, Kirua Zorudikku) is the third child of Silva and Kikyo Zoldyck and the heir of the Zoldyck Family, until he runs away from home and becomes a Rookie Hunter. He is the best friend of Gon Freecss and is currently traveling with Alluka Zoldyck.</p><br>
        <p>Initially, Killua is introduced as a character who appears similar to Gon: cheeky, cheerful, and full of mischievous ideas. However, contrasting Gon's politeness, Killua can be quite rude to others, mostly strangers and older people. He is most commonly known for having a sweet tooth; he loves everything sweet and spent almost Jenny Symbol 2011.svg200 million on snacks when he was at the Heavens Arena. His favorite snack is chocolate, specifically Chocolate Balls.
        <p><br>
        <p>
            He is also one of the quickest-thinking characters and often analyzes a situation with great ease and accuracy. In spite of his young age, his way of thinking, knowledge, and pragmatism give him the attitude of an adult. He is initially very confident about his own abilities, going as far as questioning Gon's capability during the Hunter Exam, and compares his strength with other people. As time passed, Killua became humble about it and no longer touts his own abilities. Despite his advanced knowledge and level-headed nature, he is not very open in general and will become very embarrassed when Gon openly calls him his best friend or compliments him about their bond.</p><br>
        <p>Despite his horrendous upbringings and the torturous training his family has put him under, Killua has managed to remain generally positive and does not seem too psychologically affected by the pain he's endured, demonstrating a noble, pure side of him. When showcasing his abilities and turning his Nen into electricity, both Netero and Biscuit have noted how truly tragic his childhood must have been, with the former stating that it's a miracle Killua is even able to smile at all.</p><br>
        <p>However, his ruthlessness and aptitude in killing show the other side of him—deadly, violent, and bloodthirsty. This side fades as he spends more time with Gon, although he is still unafraid to threaten or kill anyone who attacks him or Gon. Conflicting with Killua's predisposal to kill is his unyielding loyalty to his friends and natural kindness. He claims Gon was his first friend, and he grows progressively more attached to him as time passes. Killua often suffers immensely in his attempts to help his friends without a single complaint. He puts others before himself without being concerned</p>
